# IOTA Donation Bot
A IOTA Tip bot without access to private keys or seed.


## How it works
People can donate to people, which are registered within the system. The register step is just to add a valid IOTA address, where the donations will be sent to. With the command `!tip @username` the bot will show the user's IOTA address as QR code and some more options, to copy the address or directly open it with IOTA Trinity. 

The donation bot will be available for Discord and Telegram.
